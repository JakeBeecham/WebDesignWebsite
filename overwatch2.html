                <p class="justify">The developers of Overwatch and Overwatch 2, Blizzard Entertainment, have said that their aim is to <b>Redefine a Sequal</b> with Overwatch 2.  They believe players should not be punished for developers wanting to evolve and produce new content.  In many other game sequals, players start from scratch and they loose everything they accomplished in the original game.  But now, Blizzard have made their own rules.  Overwatch 2 builds on the award-winning foundation of Overwatch, becoming a hybrid of Overwatch.  Overwatch 2 will include everything that Overwatch has, but also more.  Overwatch 2 will include various new heroes and maps at launch, while adding new updated visuals to all current and future heroes of the game.  Current Overwatch players will battle side-by-side with Overwatch 2 players in PvP multiplayer, along with being able to play Overwatch 2 heroes and maps.  Accomplishments and loot collections of Overwatch players will be carried forward to Overwatch 2.  That means Overwatch players will keep their skins, player icons, sprays, emotes, and more&#33;  Therefore, Overwatch 2 is a massive, free content update for all players of Overwatch.  Not purchasing Overwatch 2 is completely an option, but, the most requested piece of content for Overwatch, is a story mode and Overwatch 2 will deliver on that.  Blizzard have said that in order to incorporate a story mode, an update must be made to the game engine, therefore a new game is required.  Find further information on Blizzard Entertainment's reasoning for redefining a sequal in the video across.
